# Traveling Salesman Problem
[![Development build](https://github.com/rijkvp/tsp/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rijkvp/tsp/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A Traveling Salesman Problem appoximation with simulated annealing.

## Usage

```sh
cargo run --release [algorithm] [input mode]
```

- **Algorithms:** choose between `annealing` and `brute-force`. The project is focused on simulated annealing but the brute force method is included as a comparison.
- **Input modes:** use `random [city count]` to generate a random number of cities or `input` to read the cities from standard input (some examples are included in the `examples` directory).

Example (simulated annealing on 40 random cities):
```sh
cargo run --release annealing random 40
```
Example (simulated annealing on a circle of 50 cities generated by the gen_circle.py script):
```sh
./examples/gen_circle.py 50 | cargo run --release annealing input
```

## Dependencies

Because the Rust standard library does not include a random number generator, the [rand](https://crates.io/crates/rand) crate is used for the random number generation.

## Visualization

The visualization code is included as an optional Cargo feature `visualize` using the [speedy2d](https://crates.io/crates/speedy2d) library.
You can this feature by running the code with the `--features visualize` option and appending v(isualize) as arguement.

Examples:

```sh
cargo run --release --features visualize annealing rand 40 visualize
cargo run --release --features visualize brute-force rand 12 visualize
```

Use the following keys to control the visualization:

- <kbd>Space</kbd> Pause
- <kbd>S</kbd> Slower speed
- <kbd>F</kbd> Faster speed
- <kbd>N</kbd> Toggle show numbers
- <kbd>P</kbd> Toggle show samples
